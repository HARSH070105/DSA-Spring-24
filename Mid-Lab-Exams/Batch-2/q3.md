# Reconstructing the Family Tree

# Introduction
Greetings, young genealogists! Today, you're tasked with uncovering a family's history from fragmented records. Imagine each ancestor as a node in a tree, with connections to their children forming branches. We've retrieved two sets of records:

Preorder Traversal: A list of ancestors visited in the order of 'Root, Left Child, Right Child'.

Inorder Traversal: A list of ancestors visited in the order of 'Left Child, Root, Right Child'.

# Your Mission:

Construct the Family Tree: Piece together these traversals to map out the family's relationships, ensuring each ancestor has their rightful place.
Handle Missing Records: If the records are inconsistent, signify that no valid tree can be formed.

Formally, given a preorder and inorder traversal, find if a valid binary tree can be constructed. If it can be constructed, print the indices of children of the nodes, else print "-1"

# Note:

The tree constructed must be rooted at $1$

# Specific Tasks:

## Input:

Number of ancestors $N$

Preorder traversal $P_1, P_2, ..., P_N$

Inorder traversal $I_1, I_2, ..., I_N$

## Output:

For each ancestor $i$ from $1$ to $N$, print their left and right children $Li$ $Ri$, representing the left and right children respectively.

If a left or right child **doesn't exist, print 0** instead of the index.

If no consistent tree is possible, print "-1".

# Constraints:

### Subtask 1 (75 marks)
Number of ancestors (N): $2 <= N <= 4,000$

### Subtask 2 (125 marks)
Number of ancestors (N): $2 <= N <= 200,000$

Ancestor labels (Pi, Ii): $1<= P_i, I_i <= N$

$P$ is a permutation of $1, 2, ..., N$

$I$ is a permutation of $1, 2, ..., N$

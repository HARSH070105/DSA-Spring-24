# Palindromic Substring

# Palindromic substring  

Given a string $S = s_1s_2 . . . s_n$ of length $N$, and $Q$ queries, each query having two integers $l$ and $r$. Find whether the substring $s_l . . . s_r$ is a Palindrome or not. Print  YES  if it is a palindrome and  NO  otherwise. 

### Constraints

* $1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ N$ 
* All characters are lowercase english alphabets (a to z)
* $1 ≤ N, Q ≤ 10^5$ 



### Input format 
The first line consists of two space separated integers $N$ and $Q$, where $N$ is the length of the string and $Q$ is the number of queries. 

The following line consists of an $N$-letter string $S$ consisting of only lowercase english alphabets.

The following $Q$ lines consist of two space separated integers $l$ and $r$, which represent the left and the right indices of the substring. 
```
N Q
S
l_1 r_1
l_2 r_2
.
.
.
l_Q r_Q
```
### Output
For every query, print YES if the substring $s_l . . . s_r$ is a palindrome, and NO otherwise.
Note that the output is case sensitive, therefore the strings YeS,YEs,No,no etc. will not
be accepted.

### Example test cases
### Test Case 1
Input
```
5 3
abbab
1 2
2 3
3 5
```
Output
```
NO
YES
YES
```
### Test Case 2
Input
```
6 3
abcdef
1 1
2 4
3 6
```
Output
```
YES
NO
NO
```
Explanation for test case 1: The substrings corresponding to the three queries are ab,bb,bab of which only the first is NOT a palindrome

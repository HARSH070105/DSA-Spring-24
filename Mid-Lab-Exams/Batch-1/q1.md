# Group 4 vs Group 5

In the inter-group contest for DSA, Groups 4 and 5 have made it to the finals after solving many tricky and difficult problems. To make things interesting, *admin* has decided to throw a curveball and ask a very simple question to try and see how fast they can solve an easy question instead, as their capabilities of handling difficult questions are already well tested.

It turns out that the question got leaked to Group 5 and so, they have already started working on it. Since that is an unfair advantage for them, your job is to help Group 4 win the contest by calculating the the sum of the values of the deepest leaves in a given binary tree, since they deserve the win more.

Deepest nodes here means that no other nodes have depth more than these nodes.

## I/O Format

$n$ → length of traversal array

$a$ → traversal array

### Input

```
n
a_0 a_1 ... a_n-1
```

### Output

```
s
```

$s$ → the required answer i.e sum of the values of the deepest leaves


**However**, please note that for this question, the driver code has been provided along with the code to create the tree. You just have to code the `deepestLeavesSum()` function. You may add extra functions if you feel the need to.

## Constraints

$1 \leq n \leq 10^4$

$1 \leq val_i \leq 100$

## Sample test case

### Input

```
13
1 2 3 4 5 -1 6 7 -1 -1 -1 -1 8
```

### Output

```
15
```

### Explanation

$ 7 + 8 = 15 $

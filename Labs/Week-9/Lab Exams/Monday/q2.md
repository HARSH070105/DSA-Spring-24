In the bustling town of *Sugartown*, there lived a young confectioner named *Yui*. *Yui* had a deep passion for candies of all shapes and flavors, but her health constraints limited her to only a certain number of candies each day.

One sunny day, *Tsumugi*, a friend of *Yui*, brought a basket full of delectable candies to share with the town's residents. Each candy was uniquely numbered and had a sweetness level described by an integer value.

*Yui*, being an ardent lover of candies, couldn't resist the temptation but had to adhere to her daily limit due to health reasons. As she pondered over which candies to choose, she realized that the order in which she consumed them could affect the total sugar penalty she incurred.

Driven by curiosity, *Yui* sought the help of her friend, the ingenious mathematician of *Sugartown*, to determine the minimum total sugar penalty she could incur for each possible number of candies she chose to eat.

# Problem Statement

In the vibrant town of *Sugartown*, there are $𝑛$ delicious candies brought by *Tsumugi*. Each candy is numbered from $1$ to $𝑛$, where the $i^{th}$ candy has a sweetness level described by an integer $a_i$.

*Yui* loves candies, but she can eat at most 𝑚 candies each day for health reasons.

Days are *1*-indexed (numbered $1,2,3,...$). Eating the candy $i$ at the $d^{th}$ day will cause a sugar penalty of $(d \cdot a_i)$, as candies become sweeter with time. A candy can be eaten at most once.

Suppose that *Yui* can choose exactly $𝑘$ candies and eat them in any order she wants. What is the minimum total sugar penalty she can get **for each** $k$, where $k$ ranges from $1$ to $n$?

# Input

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ $(1 \leq m \leq n \leq 2,00,000)$.

The second line contains $𝑛$ integers $a_1, a_2, ...., a_n$ $(1 \leq a_i \leq 2,00,000)$.

# Output

You have to output $n$ integers $x_1, x_2, ..., x_n$ on a single line, separated by spaces, where $x_k$ is the **minimum** total sugar penalty *Yui* can get if she eats exactly $𝑘$ candies.

# Constraints

$1 \leq n, m \leq 2,00,000$

$1 \leq a_i \leq 2,00,000$

# Example

### Input:

```
9 2
6 19 3 4 4 2 6 7 8
```

### Output:
```
2 5 11 18 30 43 62 83 121
```

### Sample Output Explanation

For $k = 5$, one possible way to minimize the total sugar penalty is:

* Day 1: candies $1$ and $4$
* Day 2: candies $3$ and $5$
* Day 3: candy $6$

Total penalty = $(1 * a_1) + (1 * a_4) + (2 * a_3) + (2 * a_5) + (3 * a_6) = 6 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 6 = 30$. Therefore, $x_5 = 30$.

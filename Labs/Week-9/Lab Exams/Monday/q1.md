In the quaint village of *Codehaven*, nestled amidst rolling hills and whispering forests, there lived a clever artisan named *Milo*. *Milo*'s craft was not in pottery or painting, but in the art of stick manipulation. He could shape and mold sticks into wondrous forms, but one challenge always intrigued him: how to make a set of sticks all the same length while minimizing cost.

One sunny morning, as *Milo* sat pondering this puzzle in his humble workshop, a traveler named *Luna* arrived. *Luna* was a curious soul, drawn to *Milo*'s reputation as the village's foremost stick artisan. With a gleam in her eye, *Luna* proposed a problem to *Milo*, sparking a quest for the perfect solution.

And so, with minds afire and determination in their hearts, *Milo* and *Luna* embarked on their journey to crack the enigma of stick transformation.

# Problem Statement

In the village of *Codehaven*, there are n sticks of varying lengths. *Milo*, the stick artisan, wants to modify the sticks so that each stick has the same length. He can either lengthen or shorten each stick, with both operations costing $x$, where $x$ is the **absolute** difference between the new and original length. 

**Determine the minimum total cost required to make all sticks the same length.**

# Input

The first line of input contains an integer $n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5)$: the number of sticks.
The second line contains n integers $p_1, p_2, ..., p_n (1 ≤ p_i ≤ 10^9)$, where $p_i$ is the length of the $i^{th}$ stick.

# Output

Print one integer: the  **minimum** total cost required to make all sticks the same length.

# Constraints

$1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5$

$1 ≤ p_i ≤ 10^9$

# Example


### Input:

```
5
2 3 1 5 2
```
### Output:

```
5
```

### Sample Output Explanation

In this example, the optimal strategy is to modify the lengths of the sticks to 2, resulting in the following costs:



* Stick 1: 2 (no change, cost 0)
* Stick 2: 2 (cost 1)
* Stick 3: 2 (cost 1)
* Stick 4: 2 (cost 3)
* Stick 5: 2 (cost 0)

Total cost = 0 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 0 = 5.

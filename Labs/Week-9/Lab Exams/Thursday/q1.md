In the bustling city of *Urbania*, where dreams soared as high as the towering skyscrapers, there lived a group of hopeful souls in search of a place to call home. Among them was *Maya*, a young professional with a penchant for cozy abodes and warm ambiance.

One bright morning, *Maya* found herself browsing through the listings of available apartments, her heart set on finding the perfect match. However, the journey was not without its challenges, for each apartment came with its own size and character, and *Maya* had specific preferences in mind.

As *Maya* scrolled through the listings, she pondered over the dilemma of matching her desired apartment size with the available options. Just then, a thought struck her: what if there was a way to find an apartment that closely matched her preferences?

Driven by determination, *Maya* set out to devise a solution that would maximize her chances of finding a suitable apartment amidst the sea of choices.

# Problem Statement

In the city of *Urbania*, there are n applicants and m free apartments. Your task is to distribute the apartments so that as many applicants as possible will get an apartment. Each applicant has a desired apartment size, and they will accept any apartment whose size is close enough to the desired size. 

**Determine the number of applicants who will get an apartment.**

# Input

The first line of input contains three integers ***n***, ***m***, and ***k***: the number of applicants, the number of apartments, and the maximum allowed difference.

The second line contains *n* integers $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$: the desired apartment size of each applicant. 

If the desired size of an applicant is $x$, he or she will accept any apartment whose size is between $x-k$ and $x+k$ (including both ends).

The last line contains *m* integers $b_1, b_2,..., b_m:$ the size of each apartment.

# Output

Print one integer: the number of applicants who will get an apartment.

# Constraints

$1 \leq n, m \leq 2e5$

$0 \leq k \leq 10^9$

$1 \leq a_i, b_i \leq 10^9$

# Example

### Input:

```
4 3 5
60 45 80 60
30 60 75
```

### Output:
```
2
```

### Sample Output Explanation

In this example, there are three apartments available with sizes $30$, $60$, and $75$. Out of the four applicants, two of them have their desired apartment size within a range of $Â±5$ units. Therefore, the output is $2$, indicating that two applicants will get an apartment.

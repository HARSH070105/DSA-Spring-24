# Description
In the cozy village of Mathland, young Vinay is faced with an array of his favorite candies, each with a different number of treats. Let's call this array A. Alongside this array, Vinay is given a number, let's say x, which represents the desired average number of treats per candy.

Now, Vinay loves his candies and wants to find out how many different ways he can pick consecutive groups of candies from the array A such that the average number of treats in each group equals x.

How many such groups can Vinay find?

### Formal Statement
Given an array A of size n, the task is to count the number of subarrays having an average exactly equal to x.

**Note: A subarray is a contiguous sequence of elements within a given array**

**Hint: If you observe carefully, the whole question can be boiled down to the question of counting all sub arrays with sum 0 with a few mathematical manipulations, then you can use frequency arrays to solve it, the constraints are such that the prefix sum doesn't exceed 10^6**

# Input Format
- The first line consists of an integer `n`, denoting the length of the array A.
- The second line consists of `n` integers separated by spaces, representing the elements of array A.
- The third line consists of a single integer `x`, representing the desired average number of treats per candy.

# Output Format
- Print a single integer representing the number of subarrays in array A that have an average equal to the specified value x.

# Example

## Input
```
6 
1 2 3 4 5 6 
3
```

## Output
```
3
```

## Explanation
In the provided array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], there are 3 subarrays with an average of 3:
1. [2, 3, 4]
2. [3]
3. [1,2,3,4,5]

# Constraints
- $1 <=$ `n` $<= 10^5$ (length of the array)
- `A[i]` $>= 0$
- $1 <=$ `n*x` $<= 10^6$
- $1 <=$ `n*max(A[i])` $<= 10^6$

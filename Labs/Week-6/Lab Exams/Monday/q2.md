# Description
You are given a string containing only lowercase English letters. Your task is to find the length of the longest substring within the given string that contains no repeating characters.

For example, given the input string "abcabcbb", the longest substring without repeating characters is "abc", so the output would be 3.

## Note:
A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a given string

# Input Format:
- The first line consists of an integer `n`, denoting the length of the string.
- The second line consists the string `s` of length `n`

# Output Format:
- Print a single integer representing the length of the longest substring with no repeating characters.

# Example:
## Input:
```
7
ababccd
```
## Output:
```
3
```
## Explanation:

In the provided string "ababccd", the longest contiguous substring without any repeating characters is "abc".

# Constraints:

- $1 <=$ `n` $<= 10^5$ (length of the string)
- each character of the string is in its lowercase

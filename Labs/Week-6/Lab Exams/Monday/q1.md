In a collection of words, each represented as a string, your task is to determine how many pairs of strings share the exact same combination of letters.
# Formal Problem
You have been presented with an array of strings. Your objective is to determine the total count of pairs of strings within this array that possess identical sets of alphabetic characters, considering all characters to be in lowercase.

## Note:
- Remember, the pairs are not ordered, so the pair (s1, s2) is considered equivalent to (s2, s1). Also, do not count a string as a pair with itself.


# Input Format:
- The first line consists of an integer `n`, indicating the total number of strings in the array.
- Following that, each of the next `n` lines contains a unique string from the array, representing the collection of words. Note that each string is provided in lowercase letters.

# Output Format:
- Output a single integer representing the count of pairs of strings that share the same combination of alphabets.

# Example 1:
## Input:
```
3
abcd
abcdd
acd
```
## Output:
```
1
```
## Explanation:
The first string (abcd) consists of the set of alphabets {a, b, c, d}, and the second string (abcdd) also contains {a, b, c, d}. Similarly, the third string (acd) comprises {a, c, d}. As the first two strings share the same set of alphabets, the count of such pairs is 1. 
# Example 2:
## Input:
```
4
abbbc
bccca
cdad
ccaba
```
## Output:
```
3
```
## Explanation
- Strings 1 and 2 both contain the alphabets {a, b, c}.
- Strings 1 and 4 also share the same alphabets {a, b, c}.
- Similarly, strings 2 and 4 share the alphabets {a, b, c}. 

Thus, the count of pairs with identical sets of alphabets is 3.

# Constraints:

- $1 <=$ `n` $<= 500$ (number of strings)
- $1 <=$ `length_of_each_string` $<= 1000$ (length of each string in an array)
- each letter in the strings is in lowercase.

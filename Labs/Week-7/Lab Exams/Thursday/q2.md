You are given an array of positive integers of length `n`. Find all sub-arrays of length `k` which occur more than once in the input array.

## I/O Format

### Input Format

```
n k
A[0] A[1] ... A[n-1]
```


* The first line contains two space separated integers: n (number of elements in the array) and k (size of sub-arrays to check for)
* The second line contains n space-separated integers representing the elements of the array

### Output Format
```
S1
S2
...
Si
```
Print all sub-arrays as integers (see samples) which occur more than once in separate lines.

## Constraints

-   1 <= n <= 2 â‹… 10^5

-   1 <= k <= 5

-   All elements of the array are single-digit positive integers

## Sample Testcases

### Input 1

```
10 3
1 2 3 2 3 1 2 3 2 3
```

### Output 1

```
123
232
323
```

### Input 2

```
5 2
3 7 3 7 3
```

### Output 2

```

**Problem Statement:**

You are given an array of integers and a set of queries. Each query consists of an integer. Your task is to determine the position of each query integer in the array. If a query integer is not present in the array, you should print $-1$.

**Input Format:**

The input consists of three parts:
- The first line contains two space-separated integers: `n` - the number of integers in the array, and `q` - the number of queries.
- The second line contains `n` space-separated integers representing the elements of the array.
- The third line contains `q` space-separated integers representing the queries.

**Output Format:**

Print `q` lines, each containing the position of the corresponding query integer in the array. If a query integer is not present in the array, print -1.

**Example:**

Input:
```
5 3
2 3 5 7 11
3 7 9
```

Output:
```
1
3
-1
```

Explanation:
- The query integer 3 is present at position 1 (zero-indexing) in the array.
- The query integer 7 is present at position 3 (zero-indexing) in the array.
- The query integer 9 is not present in the array, so -1 is printed.

**Constraints:**
- $1 \le$ `n`, `q` $\le 10^5$
- $0\le$ array elements, queries $\le 10^7$
- All integers in the array are distinct.

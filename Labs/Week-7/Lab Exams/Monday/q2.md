**Problem Statement:**

You are given an array of positive integers and an array of target integers. Each target integer represents a sum that you need to find in the array. Additionally, you are given an integer `k`. Your task is to count the number of index pairs `(i, j)` in the array such that `j-i >= k` and `array[i] + array[j]` equals the corresponding target integer `target[p]`.

**Input Format:**

The input consists of four parts:
- The first line contains three space-separated integers: `n` - the number of integers in the array, `q` - the number of targets, and `k`.
- The second line contains `n` space-separated integers representing the elements of the array.
- The third line contains `q` space-separated integers representing the target values.
  
**Output Format:**

Print `q` lines, each containing an integer representing the count of index pairs `(i, j)` for the corresponding target integer.

**Example:**

Input:
```
5 3 2
1 0 2 1 1
1 2 0
```

Output:
```
2
2
0
```

Explanation:
- For the first target `1`, the valid pairs is are `(1,3)` and `(1,4)`. (Since `a[1] + a[3] = 0 +1 = 1` and `a[1] + a[4] = 0 +1 = 1`)
- For the second target `2`, the valid pairs are `(0, 3)` and `(0, 4)`.  (Since `a[0] + a[3] = 1 +1 = 1` and `a[0] + a[4] = 0 +1 = 1`)
- For the third target `0`, there are no valid pairs.

**Constraints:**
- $1\le$ `n`, `q` $\le 10000$
- $1 \le$ `k` $\le n$
- $0 \le$ `array[i]`, `target[j]` $\le 10^5$

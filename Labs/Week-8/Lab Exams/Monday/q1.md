## Problem Statement
You are required to implement a min heap. You are given Q queries. The queries can be of the following types:

- **1 X** This query type inserts the element X into the min heap.

- **2** This query type removes the minimum element from the min heap.

- **3** This query type prints the minimum element of the minimum heap.

### Clarification
All testcases are valid. You won't be asked to delete or print the min element from a empty heap.


## Input Format

Each test case consists of $q$ queries. The description of the test cases is as follows:

- The first line of each test case will contain one integer $q$ representing the number of queries.
- Following would be $q$ lines of queries, each having an integer $a$, spcifying the type of the query and integers $x$, if query is of 1st type.

## Output Format

Print the minimum element in the heap whenever the query is of 3rd type in seperate line.

## Constraints

$1 \leq q \leq 10^6$

$a &isin; {1, 2, 3}$

$-1e9  \leq x  \leq 1e9$

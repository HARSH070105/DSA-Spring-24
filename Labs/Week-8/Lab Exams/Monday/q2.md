## Problem Statement
You have k apples initially. Each apple has a specific day when it will rot, given in an array `rot`. For each of the initial apple, `rot[j]` represents the number of days after which it will become rotten and inedible. Starting today, you can receive one apple per day for the next n days. The apple given on the ith day will rot after `days[i]` days, i.e. after `i+days[i]` the apple will become inedible. If `days[i]` is 0, it means you didn't receive an apple that day.

Starting from the first day you can eat at most one apple a day. Note that you can continue eating apples after the first n days.

Given an array days, return the maximum number of apples you can eat.

## Input Format

```k``` the first line contains a single integer **k** which is the no of apples you have initially

```rot[1] rot[2].... rot[k]``` the second line consists of k integer which is the rotting time of k apples

```n``` the third line contains a single integer **n** which is the no of days you might be given a single apple

```days[1] days[2]... days[n]``` the fourth line consists of n integers which tell the rotting time of the apple given on the respective day

## Output Format

output a single integer ```m``` which is the maximum apples you can eat

## Constraints

1 <= k <= 1e5

1 <= n <= 1e5

1 <= rot[i] <= 1e9

0 <= days[i] <= 1e9

## Sample Testcase

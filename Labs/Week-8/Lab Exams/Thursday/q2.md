*Light Yagami*, a strategic shopper, wants to purchase $N$ items with the least amount of money possible. Each item has a price in yen (Japan's currency), denoted by $A_i$ for the $i^{th}$ item.

Light has the advantage of $M$ discount tickets. These tickets offer a special discount when used for a purchase. For each item, Light can use any number of his remaining discount tickets ($Y$ tickets used) to get the item at a discounted price. The discount works by dividing the original price ($X$ yen) by 2 raised to the power of the number of tickets used $(X / 2^Y)$, rounded down to the nearest integer.

**Your challenge is to determine the minimum total amount of money Light Yagami needs to spend to buy all $N$ items using his available discount tickets $(M)$ strategically.**

## Input Format

```N M``` the first line contains two integer: **N** which is the number of items Light Yagami is going to buy one by one and **M** is the discount tickets Light has, and he can use any number of them when buying an item.

```a[1] a[2].... a[N]``` the second line consists of $N$ integer which is the price of the 
$i^{th}$ item Light buys.

## Output Format

Output a single integer ```m``` which is the minimum amount of money required to buy all the items.

## Constraints

$1 <= N, M <= 1e5$

$1 <= a[i] <= 1e9$

## Problem Statement
You are tasked with designing and implementing a data structure called a "Max Heap." A Max Heap is a specialized tree-based structure where each node holds a value, and the following properties are maintained:
- **Max Property:** The value of a parent node is always greater than or equal to the values of its children.
- **Complete Binary Tree:** The tree is filled as much as possible, level by level, from left to right.

You are given Q queries. The queries can be of the following types:

- **1 X** This query type inserts the element X into the max heap.

- **2** This query type removes the maximum element from the max heap.

- **3** This query type prints the maximum element of the max heap.

### Clarification
All testcases are valid. You won't be asked to delete or print the max element from a empty heap.


## Input Format

Each test case consists of $q$ queries. The description of the test cases is as follows:

- The first line of each test case will contain one integer $q$ representing the number of queries.
- Following would be $q$ lines of queries, each having an integer $a$, spcifying the type of the query and integers $x$, if query is of 1st type.

## Output Format

Print the maximum element in the heap whenever the query is of 3rd type in seperate line.

## Constraints

$1 \leq q \leq 10^6$

$a &isin; {1, 2, 3}$

$-1e9  \leq x  \leq 1e9$

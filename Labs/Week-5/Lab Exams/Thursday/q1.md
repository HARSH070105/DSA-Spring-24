# Find the Depth

## Problem Statement
In this problem, you're tasked with inserting a given array of positive integers into a binary search tree (BST) in the same order as they appear in the array. Once the BST is constructed, you need to find a specific target element within the tree and determine its depth.

## Depth
In the context of a binary tree, the depth of a node refers to the length of the path from the root node to that particular node. In other words, it indicates how many levels deep the node is within the tree. The depth of the root node is typically considered to be $0$, while the depth of nodes further down the tree increases by $1$ for each level.

## Formal Problem:
Given an array of positive integers and a target element, construct a binary search tree by inserting the array elements in the order they appear. Then, find the target element in the tree and output its depth.

## Input Format:

- The first line contains two space-separated integers: $n$ - the total number of elements in the array, and $target$ - the element to be found.
- The second line contains $n$ space-separated positive integers representing the elements of the array

## Output Format:
Output a single integer denoting the depth of the target element in the constructed binary search tree.

## Example:
### Input:
```
6 3
5 2 7 1 3 6
```

### Output:

```
2
```
### Explanation:
The given array is [5, 2, 7, 1, 3, 6]. The binary search tree constructed from this array would look like:

```
       5
      / \
     2   7
    / \ /
   1  3 6
```
The depth of the target element 3 (located in the array) is 2.

## Constraints:

- $1 \le n \le 10^5$ (number of elements in the array)
- $1 \le target \le 10^5$ (target element)
- Each element in the array is unique and fits in a 32-bit signed integer.


## Note:
You are assured that the $target$ is an element of the array.

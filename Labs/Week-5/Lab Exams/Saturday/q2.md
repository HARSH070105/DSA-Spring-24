# Problem Statement:
You are given a tree represented in level order traversal. Your task is to determine whether the given tree is a binary search tree (BST) or not.

# Definitions:
- **Binary Search Tree (BST):** A binary tree in which each node has at most two children, and for any node, all elements in its left subtree are less than or equal to the node's value, and all elements in its right subtree are greater than the node's value.
- **Level Order Traversal:** A traversal method where the nodes of a tree are visited level by level, from left to right.

# Input Format:
- The first line contains an integer `n`, the number of values given in the level order traversal.
- The second line contains `n` space-separated integers representing the values of all nodes in level order traversal.
  - If index `i` (0-indexing) represents node `i`, then index `2*i+1` represents node `i`'s left child, and index `2*i+2` represents node `i`'s right child. If the child does not exist, the value is given as -1.

# Output Format:
- Output "1" if the given tree is a binary search tree (BST), otherwise output "0".

# Example:
## Input:
```
7
2 1 3 -1 -1 -1 -1
```
## Output:
```
1
```
## Explanation:
The given tree is represented as follows:
```
     2
    / \
   1   3
```
This tree is a binary search tree (BST) because the left child of each node contains values less than the node's value, and the right child contains values greater than the node's value.

# Constraints:
- 1 <= n <= 10^5 (number of nodes in the tree)
- Each node's value is unique and fits in a 32-bit signed integer.
- The input tree is complete, i.e., all levels except possibly the last are fully filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible.


# Note: 
In this problem, level order traversal is a technique used to represent a binary tree in an array format. Here's how it works in the context of the problem:

- Root Node: The value of the root node is placed at the beginning of the array.

- Children Placement: For each node at index i in the array, its left child is located at index $2i + 1$ and its right child is located at index $2i + 2$.

- Completing Levels: If a node doesn't have a left child or a right child, the corresponding index in the array is **filled with -1** to indicate the absence of that child.

- Level-by-Level: This process continues for each level of the binary tree, with nodes being added to the array level by level, from left to right.

- Array Representation: The resulting array represents the binary tree in a serialized form, where each node's value is stored at a specific index, and the structure of the tree is preserved based on the position of the nodes' children.

In essence, level order traversal facilitates the conversion of a binary tree into an array format, allowing for easy storage, manipulation, and analysis of the tree's structure and properties.

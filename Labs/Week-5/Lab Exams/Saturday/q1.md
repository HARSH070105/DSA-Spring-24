# Introduction:
In this problem, you are given an array of positive integers and a binary path represented by $0$ s and $1$ s. You need to insert the array elements into a binary search tree (BST) in the same order as they appear in the array. Then, you traverse the tree using the provided binary path, moving to the left child if the corresponding bit in the path is $0$ and to the right child if it is $1$. Finally, you need to print the value of the node when the path ends. If the path leads out of the binary tree, print $-1$.

# Formal Problem:
Given an array of positive integers, construct a binary search tree (BST) by inserting the array elements in order. Then, traverse the BST using a binary path, where $0$ represents moving to the left child and $1$ represents moving to the right child. Print the value of the node when the path ends. If the path leads out of the binary tree, print $-1$.

# Input Format:
- The first line contains two space-separated integers: `n` - the total number of elements in the array, and `path_length` - the length of the binary path.
- The second line contains `n` space-separated positive integers representing the elements of the array.
- The third line contains `path_length` space-separated binary digits (0s or 1s) representing the binary path.

# Output Format:
- Output a single integer representing the value of the node where the path ends. If the path leads out of the binary tree, print $-1$.

# Example:
## Input:
```
5 2
10 5 15 3 7
0 1
```
## Output:
```
7
```
## Explanation:
The given array is $[10, 5 , 15 , 3 ,7]$, and the binary path is represented by the sequence $[0, 1]$.
The binary search tree constructed from this array would look like:

```
      10
      / \
     5  15
    / \
   3   7
```
Traversing the tree according to the binary path $[0 ,1]$ leads to the node with value 4. Since( we traverse $10 \xrightarrow{0} 5\xrightarrow{1}$7)

# Example2:
## Input:
```
5 3
10 5 15 3 7
0 1 1
```
## Output:
```
-1
```
## Explanation:
The given array is $[10, 5 , 15 , 3 ,7]$, and the binary path is represented by the sequence $[0, 1 ,1]$.
The binary search tree constructed from this array would look like:

```
      10
      / \
     5  15
    / \
   3   7
```
Traversing the tree according to the binary path $[0 ,1 , 1]$ **leads out of the tree**. Since we traverse $10 \xrightarrow{0} 5\xrightarrow{1}75\xrightarrow{1} \texttt{NULL}$.

# Constraints:
- $1 <=$ `n` $<= 10^5$ (number of elements in the array)
- $1 <=$ `path_length` $<= 10^5$ (length of the binary path)
- Each element in the array is unique and fits in a 32-bit signed integer.
- The binary path consists of only $0$s and $1$s.
